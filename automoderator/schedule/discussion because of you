Although Guoguo did not receive very high education, she is loved by her neighborhood because of her enthusiastic and sincere personality. But what people don’t know is that Guoguo is actually a famous embroidery workshop boss‘s daughter, and an accident caused her to grow up in the small town. Guoguo has a unique talent when it comes to embroidery. Even though Wang Aiyu (Guo Hong) strongly opposes it, Guoguo worked with dedication and persistence until she gained approval and earned a chance to study at her father’s embroidery workshop. Guoguo is very grateful for Wang Aiyu for raising her, so she views Wang Aiyu’s biological daughter, Zhang Yuxin (Wu You), as her own family. Unexpectedly, Yuxin turns out to be Guoguo’s biological mother Xu Huijie’s (Pan Yijun) apprentice. Yuxin had studied design overseas and integrated that knowledge into her embroidery, and became Guoguo’s rival. On the road to pursuing their dreams, the two girls meet brothers Li Yunkai (Deng Lun) and Li Yunzhe (Dai Chao), and love blossoms. Yuxin lost herself to fame and wealth, but Guoguo, despite challenges and setbacks, never changed her goal to learn embroidery. Ultimately, Guoguo used her heart to awaken everyone’s conscience and made great achievements in embroidery.
